My friends all say that
I'm losing touch with reality
'Cause you're just too much.

My life's been going down
Even quit my job
They all say, give him up
Makes a life too hard
But I say.

Chorus:
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love.

I keep praying it will never end
I just wanna be your lover
Log on to Top 40 db
I don't care about my friends.

You keep coming on
With that sweet caress
All those subtle looks
And that scorching kiss
And I say.

Chorus:
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love.

I'm getting weaker
As the day goes by
But your mind won't
Let my body quit.

Just keep thinking
'Bout your flashy smile
And everything that comes with it.

One of these days
Maybe they'll understand
That I'm happiest
Melting in your hands.

I can't resist you
I can't control you
I could never leave you
Just wanna hold you.

Chorus:
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love.

Chorus:
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love.

My friends all say
You got to give her up
But I say.

Chorus:
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Too much is not enough
Of your love, love, love.

I'm getting weaker
As the day goes by
But I say...
