We sparked something here once
Who's to say we can't do it again
They say Hemingway once slept here
And if the world was flat maybe this is where it ends
We took our love for granted
Boxed it up and put it on a shelf
We got lost in the chaos
I never thought we'd lose ourselves

It's like we're speaking two different languages
I see your lips are moving, don't hear a word you say
Are we calling it quits or are we saving it
We're just close enough to be too far away
Always just close enough to be too far away

Drowning in overtime, raising a couple kids
Ignoring our problems just like our parents did
I wish someone would have warned us
It look love thirty years to let us know
That the flower you don't water is the flower that won't grow

It's a million miles to the other side of the room
It might take a while to get there, but I swear I'll get here soon
